# A Monte Carlo Algorithm for Stochastic Simulation of Haromonic Solutions of Dirichlet-Neumann Mixed Boundary Value Problems

Complete algorithm, examples and visualisation tools implemented in C (simulation) and Python (visualisation)

Source code and data is provided for all examples given in the paper the paper:
Q. Han, A. Rasila, T. Sottinen: Efficient simulation of mixed boundary value problems and conformal mappings. https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15382

The softare is programmed by Mr. Qiansheng Han under supervision of Assoc. Prof. Antti Rasila, at Guangdong Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. Contributions to this code have been made by Ms. Siqi Liu (Python visualisation tool) and Mr. Yanglin Zhang (the 3D version of the algorithm and cluster computing interface). Our special thanks to the InfoGeek student club at GTIIT.
