# An Efficient Monte Carlo Algorithm for Stochastic Simulation of Harmonic Solutions of Dirichlet-Neumann Mixed Boundary Value Problems and Conformal Mappings on Simply Connected Domains

Complete algorithm, examples and visualisation tools implemented in C (simulation) and Python (visualisation)

Source code and data is provided for all examples given in the paper the paper:
Q. Han, A. Rasila, T. Sottinen: Efficient simulation of mixed boundary value problems and conformal mappings. https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15382

The publised version of the paper:
Han, Q., Rasila, A. and Sottinen, T. (2025) Efficient simulation of mixed boundary value problems and conformal mappings. Applied Mathematics and Computation 488, 1 March 2025, 129119 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amc.2024.129119

The software is programmed by Mr. Qiansheng Han under supervision of Assoc. Prof. Antti Rasila, at Guangdong Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. Contributions to this code have been made by Ms. Siqi Liu (Python visualisation tool) and Mr. Yanglin Zhang (the 3D version of the algorithm and cluster computing interface). Our special thanks to the student club InfoGeek at GTIIT and independent software developer Mr. Ziliang Wang for their help.

Update: A much more efficient CUDA conversion of the algorithm has been published. The programming of the update has been made by Mr. Yaotong Yuan, a GTIIT student assistant, under supervision of A. Rasila in 2025.
